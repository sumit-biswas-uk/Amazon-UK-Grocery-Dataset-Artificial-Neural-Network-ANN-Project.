Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for Revenue Prediction- Amazon UK Grocery:

Overview

This project aims to predict revenue using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). Revenue prediction is crucial for businesses in formulating effective strategies, optimizing inventory management, and maximizing revenue potential. Leveraging ANN, a powerful machine learning technique, we seek to accurately forecast revenue trends based on historical data.

Introduction

In this project, we present a comprehensive approach to predicting revenue using ANN. Starting from exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data cleaning to model evaluation and comparison with other techniques, we provide insights into the entire process of revenue prediction.

Dataset

The dataset used for this project comprises historical data from Amazon UK Grocery. It includes various features such as product category, item price, ratings and shipping details, with the target variable being sales revenue. The dataset is pre-processed to handle missing values, outliers, and feature engineering before being fed into the ANN model.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA involves analysing the dataset to gain insights into its structure, distributions, and relationships between variables. Through visualizations and statistical summaries, we explore the data to understand its characteristics and identify patterns.

Data Visualization

Data visualization techniques are employed to visually represent key insights and relationships within the dataset. Plots, charts, and graphs are utilized to communicate findings effectively and facilitate understanding.

Data Cleaning

Data cleaning focuses on identifying and correcting errors or inconsistencies in the dataset. This includes handling missing values, removing duplicates, and addressing outliers to ensure the quality and integrity of the data.

Data Preprocessing

The data preprocessing phase involves cleaning the dataset and converting temporal information into numerical format. We split the data into training and testing sets, mimicking real-world scenarios, where historical data is used to predict future outcomes. Additionally, we scale the data using RobustScaler to handle outliers effectively.

ANN Architecture and Hyperparameter Tuning

The architecture of the ANN model is carefully selected, considering factors such as activation functions, optimizers, and loss functions. Hyperparameter tuning is conducted iteratively to optimize model performance while avoiding underfitting or overfitting. Techniques such as dropout layers and regularization are employed to enhance model generalization.

Evaluation

Model evaluation involves assessing the performance of the trained ANN model on unseen data. Metrics such as R-squared score, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Mean Squared Error (MSE) are used to evaluate the model's accuracy and effectiveness.

Comparison with Random Forest Model

The performance of the ANN model is compared with that of a Random Forest model, highlighting differences in predictive accuracy, computational efficiency, and interpretability. Insights gained from the comparison inform decisions regarding model selection and deployment.

Summary and Reflections

The project concludes with a summary of key findings and reflections on the process of predicting sales revenue using ANN. Lessons learned and challenges encountered are discussed, providing valuable insights for further exploration.
